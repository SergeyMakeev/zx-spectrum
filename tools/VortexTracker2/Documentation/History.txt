Vortex Tracker II v1.0 beta 10

12/19/2004:

1. New Vortex Tracker II v1.0 PT3 player for ZX Spectrum Release 6 is supported.

01/02/2005:

2. Max length of pattern is 100 lines now. It is compatible with all players
   (on ZX, PC and ST). Don't recompile such modules in original ZX Spectrum
   PT3 editors (there are 64 lines max).

01/03/2005:

3. Undesired area selection during autostep was removed.
4. Highligt step for tracks' lines can be adjusted now. If Auto is on, step is
   autoselected from 3,4 and 5 depending of pattern length (specially for
   Key-Jee).

01/04/2005:

5. Added checking of module size during saving (compiling) PT3 format. If size
   is greater than 65536, error message will appear. If it is, save module in
   text format and than try to solve the problem. Alone Coder proposes to split
   it to several small modules and then play it one by other. So, you can load
   module in several windows, remove some data and save them with different
   names.
6. Added checking of block size during export to ZX-formats.

Vortex Tracker II v1.0 beta 11

04/23/2005:

1. Added Amadeus (Fuxoft AY Language) modules import. Both FXM and ZXAYAMAD are
   supported. The most modules require manual editing, but sounds good and
   without it.

04/24/2005:

2. Memory for patterns/samples/ornaments are static now, i.e. you can decrease
   and increase its length without losting last lines previous values.
3. Fixed error: fault when trying to play empty (default) pattern by F7/F8.
4. Patterns/samples/ornaments length can be changed during playing now.

04/26/2005:

5. Maximal length of pattern is 256 lines now. To keep 2 columns line numeration
   it is hexadecimal now.

05/01/2005:

6. Undo/Redo functions are added. Try to test and send me bugreports or wishes.

05/04/2005:

7. Due HalfElf's request, added ability to load modules into editor from command
   line. Several files must be divided by spaces, and filenames with spaces must
   be placed to doublequotes.

Vortex Tracker II v1.0 beta 12

05/29/2005:

1. Fixed error in PT2 importer: memory before sample import was not clear.

06/14/2005:

2. Fixed horrible mistake: if you open save or some other dialogs during playing
   in "Loop among all opened modules" and next window start playing before you
   will finish, dialog will work with new active window. From this version
   all dialogs work with window, which was active during calling dialog.
   
09/16/2005:

3. Added import of PSC v1.00-1.03 modules.

09/30/2005:

4. Added import of compiled PSM (Pro Sound Maker by Denis Dratov) modules. They
   must be compiled by original (author's) compiler.

Vortex Tracker II v1.0 beta 13

10/02/2005:

1. Fixed error in PSM import: loop position always was zero.

03/14/2006:

2. In addition to 'Save As...' command added simple 'Save' (asks for file name
   only for new modules).
3. Added save requests before closing module windows or whole editor.

03/16/2006:

4. Added second sound chip emulation to play any two opened modules
   simultaneously. 'Play' and 'Play from start' start playing module of current
   window through the first chip and module selected in dropdown list of control
   panel through the second chip. So, you can edit two standard PT3-modules, and
   then play it simultaneously through some of known devices (Turbo-Sound or
   Turbo-AY) on real ZX (see example in ZX-magazine InfoGuide #8).

03/18/2006:

5. MC68000 PT3-player is updated (SNDH-export). Note and volume tables are
   packed now via Ivan Roshin methods (player size is 1 KB smaller now).
6. SNDH-export is improved: new SNDH v2 TAGs are supported and new file name
   extension (SNDH) is used now.

03/19/2006:

7. 'Options' dialog allows you to input any AY-frequency in range 1-3.5 MHz, and
   any player frequency in range 1-2000 Hz.
8. Added track colors selection in 'Options' dialog.

03/25/2006:

9. Fixed tracks editor's cursor moving errors (PageUp/PageDown reaction).

Vortex Tracker II v1.0 beta 14

10/01/2006:

1. Window for 2nd chip is autoselected during changing module window. No need to
   select it manually now (if you are editing only two modules in TS mode, of
   course).
2. During playing in TS mode tracks moving of both windows are sinchronized now.
3. During editing in TS mode tracks and cursors of both windows are sinchronized
   too.
4. In TS mode cursor moving to the maximum right or left position of tracks
   editor will activate window of 2nd chip in same position of tracks editor.
5. "Play from position" function (F5) works from current cursor position now.

10/03/2006:

6. Fixed bug: envelope period changed in AutoEnv mode was not added to the undo
   list (thanks to Karbofos for bug-report).

Vortex Tracker II v1.0 beta 15

03/04/2007:

1. Module window is redesigned for more comfortable editing in TS mode (thanks
   to Znahar for ideas and help).
2. No need to close Tracks Manager window now, it stays on top and works with
   current module, which name is duplicated in main window title (specially for
   (Znahar).

03/08/2007:

3. Selected track area can be transposed by calling pop-up menu or from keyboard
   (Num +, Num -, Ctrl+Num +, Ctrl+Num - (+-semiton/+-octave). New function
   works with notes and envelope track.
4. Fixed error: after using AutoStep current time was not updated.
5. AutoStep works after pasting from clipboard now (specially for TAD).
6. Fixed error: trying to start playing of just created (empty) module in TS
   mode rised error message (thanks to Znahar for bug-report).
7. AutoStep can be used with insert/delete/clear track/pattern line. Can be
   useful for increasing/decreasing pattern size twice (thanks to TAD for idea).
8. Fixed error: the most Undo/Redo operations not updated module duration info.
9. Fixed error: after insert/delete/clear track/pattern line module duration and
   current time info was not updated.

03/10/2007:

10. Some Znahar's ideas was added: Global Transposition window can be always
    opened; the most buttons of tools panel can be removed via pop-up menu; size
    and position of main window is saved during closing.
11. Fixed error: if envelopes in channel is disabled in Editor Controls, you can
    hear tone and noise if they enabled in sample now (thanks to TAD for bug-
    report and test module).
12. You can input -96 and +96 numbers in ornament editor (works like 95, but -96
    is used in many PT3-modules from ZX Spectrum). Thanks to TAD for info.

Vortex Tracker II v1.0 beta 16

04/30/2007:

1. New Release 7 of ZX player is used for exporting. New version allows right
   work of 1.xx and 2.xx special commands for PT 3.7 modules.
2. Added import of PT 3.7 modules are saved in TS-mode (module automatically
   converted to two single PT3-modules).

05/01/2007:

3. Fixed bug: during playing module VT didn't alow to change position value in
   other module windows.
4. Fixed loading modules bug: not used lines of pattern was not cleared, and
   after increasing pattern length random trash can be shown in last lines.
5. Some PT 3.6 structure analizer was added to prompt user about loading PT 3.6
   modules as Turbo Sound.
6. Added PT 3.7 editor mode, which allows to use special commands 1.xx and 2.xx
   to single change tone frequency by xx value down or up.
7. 3xxx interpretation type option changed to Features level selection:
   ProTracker 3.5, Vortex Tracker II (PT 3.6) and ProTracker 3.7. Each mode
   marked in module by own header.
8. Some redesign of pattern editor window (specially for ch41ns4w).
9. Highlight step can be 0 now (same as 256 and same as 'no highlight' option,
   specially for TAD).

Vortex Tracker II v1.0 beta 17

05/13/2007:

1. TS-mode is turning on after loading TS-module. If only two windows are opened
   they are tiling horizontally also.
2. Added new TS-format loader (used in Ay_Emul 2.9 beta 2).
3. Changed 2nd module pointing method for TS-mode. Now you can point one window
   two another individually.
4. Again redesign of pattern editor window (specially for Ch41ns4w).

05/18/2007:

5. During saving one of module in TS-mode, 2nd module is added to result file
   too. In text format modules fallow one for another, so you can merge two
   single modules without editor in command line:

     copy Module1.txt+Module2.txt Module.txt.

   During saving PT3 16 bytes identifer is added at the end of result file. More
   simplier to save it from editor, but you still do same in command line:

     copy/b Module1.pt3+Module2.pt3+ID Module.pt3

   where ID is next structure file:
    +0 Str4 'PT3!'
    +4 Word Module1.pt3 file size
    +6 Str4 'PT3!'
    +A Word Module2.pt3 file size
    +C Str4 '02TS'
6. AutoStep range is expanded to +-256.
7. Fixed error: in no loop mode more short module of TS-pair plays first tick of
   loop position before stopping.
8. Fixed error: color text on some buttons was set to black instead of system
   window text color (thanks to Roman Kuraev for bug-report)..

05/19/2007:

9. Added new TS-player for ZX exporting of TS-modules. Don't forget to load in
   DE register address of second module.
10.Max size of ornament is upped to 255 (old 64 lines limitations was only in
   ZX Spectrum editor, not in players). New size limit allows to import long 
   ornaments from ASC and PSC modules.
11.PSC-files import is improved (see guitar.psc by Mast).

Vortex Tracker II v1.0 beta 18

11/20/2008:

1. Tracks redrawing moved from additional to main thread via windows messages
   for more safe and stable work (but without measured moving warranty).
2. Specially for TAD new tool "Toggle samples" (Ctrl+M) was made (seek at Play
   menu or on tool panel). Tool allows to mute sound of any samples to hear/mute
   standalone parties of composition (drum, main theme, echo, etc).
3. Due many requests channel numbers in Track Manager are literal now (A, B and
   C). In type field can be input numbers from 0 to 2 as usually.

11/22/2008:

4. Specially for TAD added Shift+Backspace shortcut to do step backward if
   AutoStep is on.
5. Serious bug was found: if new typed value is equal to existing one, change
   is not added to Undo, but numbers of line and channel stored somewhere (if
   first change than can be access violation, if not first - in previous action,
   that's not good too). Fixed.

11/24/2008:

6. Especially for TAD after changing pattern number or activating module window
   its number is copied to Tracks Manager and Global Transposition windows.
7. In input pattern size field you can press PageUp and PageDown to increase/
   decrease pattern size with highlight step value (for TAD).
8. You can select position in OrderList of 2nd window during playing in Turbo
   Sound mode to restart playing from.
9. Pop-up menu or keys / and * on numpad allows to compress/expand pattern size
   by 2 times (specially for TAD). Just set new speed to keep tempo after
   operation if you need.

11/25/2008:

10.Due Roman Kuraev request added new function Merge (Ctrl+Alt+V or pop-up menu)
   to Paste from clipboard without erasing existing pattern data with empty
   values. Can be useful for making echo or inserting 2nd party between notes of
   main party.
11.Copy of Tracks Manager is added to Undo, but all previous Undo actions is
   cleared. Fixed.
12.Due TAD request, all operations of Tracks Manager can exceed patterns size up
   to maximum pattern length (256) if work lines number allows. This feature
   allows you to increase pattern size after operation.
13.Fixed old error in ZX player export: bad player relocation for some address
   (for example, B1DD for TS-player) due carry ignoring when low byte of address
   is bigger than some value.

11/26/2008:

14.For TAD editing 1st module in TS-mode makes available Save button (and query
   for saving before closing) after switching to 2nd module even if it is not
   edited yet.

Vortex Tracker II v1.0 beta 19

02/08/2009:

1. TAD has pointed, that initally unused or loaded samples can be muted (after
   appearing version with Toggle Samples tool). Fixed.

Vortex Tracker II v1.0 beta 20

06/16/2022:

1. Windows 9x is not supported now.
2. Bug fix: right length in hobeta header for non-TS module without player (was
   16 bytes bigger).
3. Digital sound engine changed to Ay_Emul 2.9 beta 31's.
4. More perfect AY emulation engine from Ay_Emul 2.9 beta 31.
5. Options are stored in VT.cfg now (like Ay_Emul in home folder of current
   user, or in VT executable folder, if you move it or create empty yourself).
6. STC loader can extract author' strings from 'KSA SOFTWARE COMPILATION OF '
   and 'SOUND TRACKER COMPILATION OF ', insterted in Ay_Emul methodic.
7. Added import of uncompiled Sound Tracker 1.xx (ST1 file extension).
8. Added import of compiled Sound Tracker 3 (ST3 file extension).
9. Added import of uncompiled Sound Tracker Pro (STF file extension).
10.Added import of compiled ASC Sound Master 0 (AS0 file extension).
11.TS-module's windows are aligned after opening even if other modules was
   loaded bedore.
12.In windows loop play mode added checking if TS-pair to skip replaying twice.
13.If TS-window playing starts, linked TS-window brings to foreground now.

06/17/2022:

14.Text module loader slightly extended to load Ivan Pirog's vt2, vtp, vts and vto.

Vortex Tracker II v1.0 beta 21

06/21/2022:

1. Fixed old error in FTC import: sample length could exceed maximum for PT3,
   but was no checking (see "Joe of DR\Binary Love 1.ftc" module).

06/22/2022:

2. Fixed old error in FTC import: musician could point noise in special command
   out of 5-bit range (00..1F), import takes low 5 bits now.

06/23/2022:

3. Atari ST (export to SNDH) player can play PT 3.7 modules with special
   commands 1.xx and 2.xx now.
4. Added Fast Tracker 1.07 and 1.08 modules import (can be one of two note
   tables (1 or 2) now, and also for 1.08+ Retrig special command is imported
   as R11R12R13 doublicates in corresponding channel.
5. FTC ornament set import is improved: all single ornaments are not prefixed
   by Envelope Off command now, excepting zero (empty) one.

06/24/2022:

6. Reverse loading order is removed if opening several modules at once.
7. Tn, Ns and En buttons in module window was renamed to T, N and E
   correspondingly.

07/02/2022:

8. Added .AY type ZXAYST11 (ST1 analog) import.
9. Delphi->Lazarus fix: in beta 20 tracks redrawer ignores highlight step
   changing in "Auto" mode.

Vortex Tracker II v1.0 beta 22

08/29/2022:

1. Delphi->Lazarus fix: starting from beta 20, when loading any module, the
   variable storing the number of the current pattern was always initialized
   with a zero value, and if the first position of the loaded module contained
   a non-zero pattern, then this led to an incorrect reaction to user actions
   before explicitly selecting a position with some non-zero pattern.

12/07/2022:

2. Fixed an error in the PSM pattern decoder for the F9 "GoSub" command (it was
   not implemented in the native compiler, so it did not lead to a crash).

03/29/2023:

3. The number of visible lines in the ornament editor is no longer fixed and
   varies depending on the height of the pattern editor defined in the options
   (by analogy with the sample editor).
4. The cursor in the sample or ornament editor can no longer be placed in a
   gray (i.e. not editable) area.
5. Improved cursor control in the sample and ornament editor (including the
   mouse wheel).
6. There is a pop-up menu has been added by right mouse button clicking in the
   sample and ornament editor, so changing signs and accumulation fields has
   been reassigned to the middle one. The amplitude drawing still by the right
   button (the popup menu in the amplitude drawing area is not called).
7. Using the cursor keys (when Shift is pressed) or the mouse, you can select
   an area in the sample and ornament editor (by analogy with the pattern
   editor).
8. Modified the change (when entering from the keyboard) of the number, loop
   point and length of the sample/ornament (added checks for out-of-range,
   replacing the entered garbage with the previous value, completing editing
   with the Enter key).

04/01/2023:

9. The AutoStep is now also turned on during editing or changing the auto step
   value.

04/02/2023:

10.Delphi->Lazarus fix: there was no corresponding event when deleting a
   position (drawing a new pattern and moving the selection when deleting the
   last position).
11.Delphi->Lazarus fix: the pattern/position number field in the Tracks Manager
   and Global Transposition windows was not updated when changing it in the
   pattern editor.
12.Delphi->Lazarus fix: the channel number did not change in the Tracks Manager
   window when entering its name or number in the text field.
13.The channel number in Location 2 could not change correctly in the Tracks
   Manager window when pressing Up or Down from the keyboard.
14.Delphi->Lazarus fix: due to the difference in the processing and occurrence
   of events during or after editing text and numeric controls, some changes
   were not always adequately applied or visualized, the code was revised and
   the corresponding event handlers of almost all TEdit, TUpDown, etc. elements
   were adapted to the behavior of Lazarus.
15.The selected area cleaning, copying and cutting it to the clipboard has been
   added into the ornaments and samples editing fields.
16.Undo/Redo has added the ability to practice the actions described in the
   previous paragraph, and by the way the code has been revised to improve the
   cursor displaying at the time of the corresponding change.

04/03/2023:

17.Added a frame around the selection for better visualization of the cursor
   position (because the cursor may not flash when working through mstsc).
18.Added the ability to insert a fragment of an ornament from the clipboard
   (previously copied there) in the ornament editing field (using standard hot
   keys or a command from the popup menu). The insertion is made starting from
   the cursor and may exceed the length of the edited ornament; if necessary,
   the length can be increased both before and after insertion, because the
   data inserted beyond the ornament border is not erased. If an area is
   selected in the ornament, then the inserted data is cut off along its
   borders.

04/04/2023:

19.The insertion of samples from the clipboard is implemented by analogy with
   ornaments. You can copy and paste various parts of the sample (i.e. those
   that hit into the selected area). For example, you can copy a part of a
   column with tone deviation signs, and paste it into any column where such
   signs are allowed (even into a column with noise/envelope deviation signs).
   The same liberties are allowed with masks (for example, a tone mask can be
   copied into a noise mask), and with numbers (for example, you can copy a
   column with zero tone deviations and paste it into a column with amplitudes
   to reset them).
20.Fixed the same type of transposition error when importing STP, STC, FTC and
   SQT (see in previous beta versions of Vortex Tracker II the end of pattern 2
   of channel A in Push\%nom-2a.stp and Push\%nom-2a.stc). Thanks to TAD for
   detecting the glitch.

04/06/2023:

21.The ability to work with the clipboard (selection, copying, pasting, etc.)
   has been added to the sample and ornament test lines. You can copy and paste
   data both from the test lines and from the pattern. You can open a popup
   menu by right mouse button clicking on the test line.

04/07/2023:

22.The volume control has been redesigned: it does not take away the keyboard
   focus from other controls now; you can either simply left mouse button
   click or move it with the already pressed one.

04/08/2023:

23.Fixed a bug: the title of the edited window was updated, but the main one
   was not after working Save As...

04/09/2023:

24.Bug fixed: the list of digital audio output devices was supplemented with
   the same lines every time the Options window was called.

Vortex Tracker II v1.0 beta 23

04/25/2023:

1. Delphi->Lazarus fix: tasks have been created in the Lazarus bug tracker
   regarding the incorrect operation of MDI windows, since have not yet been
   fixed, the corresponding problems have been masked (see the comments in the
   code).

04/26/2023:

2. Bug fixed: a zero uninitialized pattern is displayed in the newly created
   module, and this was not taken into account in the procedure for manually
   setting the highlight step, as a result, a failure occurred when trying to
   manually change it.
3. If only one TS pair is loaded and the "Loop all" mode is selected, the
   melody was repeated not from the loop position, but from the beginning
   (fixed).
4. An "S" button (solo) has been added to the sound control of each of the
   channels, which, when pushed on, silences all other channels, except for
   those with a similar button also pushed on (the idea is borrowed from Ivan
   Pirog's Vortex Tracker II v2.6 project).
5. The pattern tabsheet was redesigned in order to transfer the sound control
   buttons of each channel to the gap above the corresponding channel (as in VT
   II v2.6).
6. Only monospaced fonts are now displayed in the font selection dialog of the
   Options window, so the frightening red inscription about the need to select
   only monospaced fonts has been removed.

04/28/2023:

7. Added the ability to resize the editable modules windows by height, the
   number of rows in the editable pattern varies depending on the height of the
   window (as in VT II v2.6).
8. Now the windows of TS pairs are automatically attached to each other if the
   size of the workspace is wide enough for two windows. The window opened or
   created first is displayed on the left.
9. When changing the size or position of one of the windows in TS-pair, similar
   changes are made with the second window.
10.The sample string templates have been removed from the Samples tabsheet.
11.Statistics and "Copy To" fields have been removed from the Samples and
   Ornaments tabsheets.

04/29/2023:

12.The number of visible lines in the sample and ornament editors has now also
   become dynamic (depends on the size of the editable module window).
13.When closing the TS-pair window, the second one is now automatically closed
   (with the exception of the modules that have just been hooked and have not
   yet been saved as a TS-pair, i.e. with different file names).
14.When saving a TS pair, the module with the smallest window number is now
   saved first (that is, the one that was created or loaded earlier).

05/01/2023:

15.Now the font of tracks set in the Options window is applied not only to new
   windows, but also to already created ones.

05/02/2023:

16.Added font customization separately for samples, ornaments and their testing
   lines.
17.Added customization of the colors of the sample and ornaments editors, as
   well as their test lines.

05/03/2023:

18.The chip type was not saved on the exit starting from beta 20 (fixed).
19.The Options window has been redesigned, including the separate control of
   the visual and audio channel layout has been removed, they always switch
   synchronously now.
20.When entering an atypical chip or interrupts frequency, calling the Options
   window again led to a failure (SetFocus error, because the ability of the
   frequency input field to accept keyboard focus was incorrectly determined).

05/05/2023:

21.The reaction to the mouse wheel rotation in the position editor was removed
   (visually nothing happened, but in playback mode, playback was restarted
   from this position).
22.An attempt was made to the Lazarus grid property circumvent (a position
   editor was made from it): when the mouse moved with the pushed button, the
   position was selected (including reselected, which caused a frequent restart
   of its playback in playback mode). Perhaps in the future it will be better
   to make own position editor (on the same principle as for tracks, samples,
   etc.).

Vortex Tracker II v1.0 beta 24

05/10/2023:

1. Fixed another bug of manually selecting the highlight step on a newly
   created (i.e. empty and uninitialized) pattern: when trying to enter a zero
   step, a failure occurred.
2. The "Decimal numbering" and "Decimal noise" buttons have been added above
   the corresponding tracks to switch to the decimal numbering of track lines
   and display the noise period at any time (a similar idea is implemented in
   Ivan Pirog's Vortex Tracker v2.6).
3. Two parameters for new windows have been added to the options window for the
   same purpose: "Decimal noise period" and "Decimal line numbering".
4. Font styles are now ignored (except for bold).
5. The cursor width could be displayed incorrectly in the tracks during Undo
   (when alternating changes in notes and parameters). Fixed.

05/11/2023:

6. The "Envelope as note" button has been added above the envelope track. The
   option has been asked to be implemented for a long time (TAD asked me about
   it for the first time many years ago), but I put it on hold until I saw the
   implementation in Ivan Pirog's Vortex Tracker II v2.6 and wanted to do it a
   little differently: the envelope period is replaced by a note only if a
   cyclic envelope type is specified in one of the channels; the octave of a
   note depends not only on the envelope period, but also on its type; if the
   envelope type is specified in several channels, the type from the largest by
   channel number is taken (this is how all the players I know are arranged).

05/12/2023:

7. Octave 0 has been added to display the envelope periods up to FF and C-0,
   everything below is displayed traditionally in HEX.
8. Another parameter has been added to the Options window for new windows,
   "Envelope as note", which allows you to make the corresponding displaying
   the envelope period mode the default mode.
9. Editing of the envelope period track in the pattern has been modified for
   the "Envelope as note" mode: a wide cursor; input with note keys;
   calculation and substitution of a note in the appropriate channel (if
   AutoEnv is enabled); clearing the selection and cutting/copying it to the
   clipboard have been rewritten so that all four digits of the envelope period
   are captured, if in their place a note is displayed; switching the "Envelope
   as note" mode corrects the cursor position and selection boundaries in the
   area of the envelope period display. To enter notes from octave 0, turn on
   octave 1 and use the standard keyboard shortcut to enter a note an octave
   lower (Ctrl+Shift+NoteKey).

10.Now you can insert notes from any channel from the clipboard into the
   envelope period track. If the envelope type is specified in one of the
   channels when inserting the target pattern in the corresponding line, it
   will be taken into account when recalculating from the note number to the
   envelope period, otherwise the calculation is performed as for a type 8
   envelope (the same result as type C).
11.Bug fixed: when pasting from the clipboard into a newly created (i.e. empty
   and uninitialized) pattern, a crash occurred.
12.The envelope periods copied to the clipboard (in any display mode) can now
   be inserted into the note tracks of any of the channels. The conversion of
   the period to the note number is performed as for an envelope of type 8/C.
   If these periods were used with the A/E type, you will need to manually
   transpose the result an octave lower. If the periods are copied in the
   traditional display mode (HEX), you need to capture all four digits before
   copying, only in this case the insertion algorithm will group them as one
   whole if the insertion is made in a track with notes.

13.A table number selection for new modules has been added to the Options
   window.
14.Another idea from Ivan Pirog's Vortex Tracker II v2.6 has been implemented:
   when changing the note table in the module, the envelope periods can be
   recalculated. You can disable this feature in the Options window. A window
   appears with a request to confirm the operation before the recalculation,
   because it cannot be rollbacked via Undo.
15.Transposition in envelope period tracks is now done according to the
   envelope periods to notes conversion table, and not to the formula (the idea
   is taken from Vortex Tracker II v2.6). For this reason, those periods that
   are not recognized as notes (outside of the note range or indicating a
   non-cyclic envelope type) are no longer transposed.
16.Added tooltips for the selected tone table number, indicating which clock
   frequency of the music chip they are suitable for.
17.The Close All to close all windows and Find Module to search for a window by
   a fragment of the file name, title or author's name items have been added in
   the Windows menu (thanks to Alexander Boolba for the icon and code).

18.The standard Cascade Windows method has been replaced with the code provided
   by Alexander Boolba. When cascading, windows (including TS pairs) are
   positioned better now.
19.If one of the TS-pair windows becomes active, the second one is also brought
   to the foreground (thanks to Alexander Boolba for the code).
20.New windows positioning is now performed by Alexander Boolba's Cascade
   Windows algorithm.

21.The standard Tile Vertically and Tile Horizontally methods have been
   replaced with code provided by Alexander Boolba.
