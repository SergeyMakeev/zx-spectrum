.: Information :.

The following are the results of the competitions held at the 2006
raww.orgy2 (the second coming) in Yeovil, England. The party took
place on the weekend of 17th February 2006, and the voting for the
competitions took place at around 23:00 on Saturday 18th February
2006.

The voting was carried out by all of the people at the party (9
people, 8 valid votesheets). Their names will not be disclosed here
for fear of death threats. The voting was "blind" - the names of
the creators of the entries were not disclosed to the voters until
after the the event, with the exception of the Intro's which were
shown "as provided". Marks were given out of 10 for each entry, so
80 is good, and 0 is, uhm... not good. That's it. Enough with the
crap... let's get on with the results.

.: Comments :.

I must say I was surprised with the response to this party - there
are more entries than I was expecting, which is great. To have as
many as 5 entries in the 256b Intro competition is good, and they're
well-coded too. Nice stuff.

I'm working on prizes - hopefully with a bit more luck than last
year. If I manage to get prizes sorted out, I'll contact the winners
for their details. If I don't... I'm sorry, but hey, it's a
prestigious event so winning should be it's own reward :]

Check raww.org and party.raww.org for an upcoming report and photos
of the party. And if you see any reports or photos, let me know so
that I can link to them.

Roll on next year?
