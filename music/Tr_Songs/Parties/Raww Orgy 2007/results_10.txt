.: Comments :.

This is where I get to talk about the competitions and results, tho' I won't
write much as I'm ill at the moment. The response to this party has been great -
perhaps it's due to the prizes from last year, which I think I've improved on.
I won't comment on the voting (only one of the winners was actually at the party
so I don't think it influenced who gets prizes - perhaps it influenced who comes
second and third tho'), only to say that some of the positions surprised me a
little. But that's my personal opinion so I'll keep it to myself.

I should also say that the music player seemed to mess up LaesQ's entry a little
which we're investigating. The song sounds a little different in Vortex Tracker,
so perhaps LaesQ will release an MP3 of how it should sound. Either way I think
that it wouldn't affect the final result, as Soviet Alarmclock is simply lovely.
