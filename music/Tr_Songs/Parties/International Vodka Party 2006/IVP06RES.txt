International Vodka Party 2006 (that was a 3rd edition)
took a place  in Poland, in Krakow city, 28 - 30 April 2006.
Organized by YERZMYEY/H-PRG^AY_R.

It was a ZX SPECTRUM party although with a presence
of ATARI XL/XE computers and presentations.

Guests came from following countries: Poland, Czech, England.

There were 2 compos: 
4 channels MOD compo for ZX Spectrum with General-Sound card
and
Idiotic Demo compo (for the most stupid ZX demo :) ).

*****THE RESULTS*****

Idiotic  Demo Compo:

1. Shock (EQUINOX) - 99
2. Vodkemon (GASMAN, MISTER BEEP, EXIN) - 98

Out of compo
RotoZlow (ICABOD) - the production for Idiotic Demo Compo came
too late. :( WE ALL REGRET IT!


MOD Compo:

1. Drink Vodka or Eat Mrtka z Krtka (FACTOR6 / AY_R) - 102
2. Old-School Rave Part 2 (YERZMYEY / H-PRG^AY_R)- 98
3. Molition Day - 84 (TDM / AY_R)

If You use an emulator, use some that has GENERAL SOUND
card emulation.  THE BEST WOULD BE "Z80 STEALTH"
