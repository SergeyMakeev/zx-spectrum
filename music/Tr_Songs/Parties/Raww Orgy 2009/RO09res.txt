Well then, this would be the very quickly put-together-before-my-tea Results
file for this years raww.orgy!  The event took place in St4vs house in wintery
Exeter, in South West England.  Attendance was low, with only 5 voters for the
competitions, but the entries were, as usual, of a high standard.

The party took place from 6th to 8th of February 2009.

We had in total 6 music entries (lower than usual), and 6 graphics entries...
sadly the graphics entry by BITS arrived late.  Also arriving late was their
rather nice 256b intro, leaving 9 participants in the compo.

But enough scribbling... the results...
Format is: Place, Score (out of 50), title/author/group.

Congratulations to the winners.  The organisers (myself and/or LaesQ) will

they're not yet ready).
