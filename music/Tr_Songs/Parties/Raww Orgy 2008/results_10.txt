.: Comments :.

This was quite an unprecented competition for the simple fact that, until
Gasman, Justinas and Ellvis decided to write tunes for the competitions (which
they all did quite last-minute) we actually had more 256b Intros than anything
else. I think it's because writing something in that amount of space is a good
test of the coders skills.

The voting was quite fair - a couple surprising results further down the lists
perhaps, but none of the winners were at the party this year so we can't claim
that there was any favouritism with who gets the prizes. All of the work was of
a high standard, and it was good to see that so many people are interested in
such a small UK party - maybe I'm just foolish, but it seems that each year we
bring new talent out of the woodwork... or at least people who have not been on
the scene for a loooong time.

Through Polonium was the only "through" song this year, tho' it hasn't broken
the trend of having a "through" song in each competition. If we do this again we
should maybe have a "songs-called-through..." compo just for them. Hmm.

I should also note that a couple of the entries weren't included in the main
player, so you'll need to look at/listen to them separately... the winning graf
was an interlaced piece by Riskej, and my custom-coded player was custom-coded
enough to view it :) If you have a DivIDE you can just select the file to view
it. And also we had a really hard time getting Ellvis' music to compile, so we
ended up using a snapshot of SQ-Tracker... but it worked ok. Maybe I'll try to
get it into the player at some point.

So. That's it. Enjoy the works. We did.
