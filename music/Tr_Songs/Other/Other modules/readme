Hi,

this is an infofile for the 5channel(*) replaying routine
used in the Chase HQ game. I tried to rip and hack it
for it to use my own 3 channel tune in combination with
those brilliant beep drums. Wow, sounds great but it needs a
bit of fiddling with it, as the drums are slightly slowing
down the AY tune - maybe it's just only my opinion. Check for
yourself.


(*) 3x AY + 2!x BEEP drums


Here are the most important addresses to be used for further
hacking and for running this:

-start replaying 			- 30000 (simple call-keypress-jump routine)
 
  A-reg has to be set to 0 - use SS+N and CURSOR to set the register to zero
			     and SS+H for execution

-tempo of the beep drums 		- 64164
-beginning of the patterns for drums	- 64165 (mail me for the info on the pattern struc.) 
-IM2 jump				- 48573 (JP 63661)
-AY tune				- 32768-INIT, 32774-PLAY (std. SoundTracker player)
63535 - call PLAY (originally there was CALL 60529 (ChaseHQ AY tune)

Replaying is somehow synchronized via IM2 (see code at 63661, it stores 255 to 63656),
dunno how it really works. Used AY tune is unknown, not mine :-)

If you make the BEEP routine not to slow down the AY tune, please contact me,
or publish it on my board (http://xagon.webz.cz/board/board.php) or at
http://www.raww.org. Thank you!
