Seems, 3dbals.stp is bad conversions from STC, so I decided to keep Iris UD - Crazy Balls.vtx recorded in demo
3DBALL2.stc and 3DBALLS.stc seems work versions (was in Voxon's folder), but close to Mr.Nik's 3dbals.stp

FASTMUS.stp maybe by Slack Den
flash time #01 - track14.stp aka 	MUSIC BY MR.NIK OF FLASH (from 1996 year intro Side Arms)
BARSDEMO.stc also found in Newart's archive in Voxon's folder
Drafts of 3dbals.stp found in Voxon folder (3DBALL2.stc and 3DBALLS.stc)
