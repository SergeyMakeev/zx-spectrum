ZX Spectrum Tracker Music Archive v6.0
Release date: 04.06.2023

1. Introduction

The archive contains only ZX Spectrum musical editors’ modules in original
formats. Say 'No' to any AY, YM, VTX, WAV, MP3, OGG and so on ;)

See 'readme', 'file_id.diz' and so on in each folder for more info.
Full info about some songs is stored in 'Playlists' folder.

Take place in this project - send me links, files, information and so on.

Thanks to all men, who send me music, info, playlists, comments and links.

2. Additional information

Files in this archive are music modules for "AY-3-8910/12 Emulator" (also known
as 'AY Emulator' and 'Ay_Emul') by S.V. Bulba and for real ZX Spectrum computer.
These files were got from different games and demos of ZX Spectrum and can be
playing or importing in various ZX Spectrum and not only ZX Spectrum players
and music editors (trackers).

Some music is interesting, but cannot be ripped in original format, so
AY-3-8910 register dumps was recorded to VTX-format (see Vortex Project by
V_Soft) or YM-format (see ST-Sound Project by Leonard), and ZX Spectrum memory
dumps was placed to AY-format (see ProjectAY by bcass).

Archive is generated from Tr_Songs Base, the program for working with huge
music collection and musician data base. Here some statistics for this version:

- total number of music files: 28527
- number of new music files (comparing with previous version): 253
- total number of playlist files: 6754
- total number of text files: 710

The most music is sorted into Authors folder, so you can find many AYL-files
in other folders. AYL is playlist format of Ay_Emul and is used in the archive
to simulate just link to corresponding music. Of course, it’s used as usual
playlist too (mostly in Playlists folder, where I've placed also original
playlists of some other men).
